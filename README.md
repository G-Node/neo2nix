# python-neo-nixio

NIX IO for python-neo.

This repository was originally used to develop the NIX IO for python-neo. Since the IO was merged into the Neo repository, further development and bug fixes are made on the [G-Node python-neo fork](https://github.com/G-Node/python-neo).

This repository is no longer used.
